Description: This is library performantly translates linear models into 'SQL' and deploys them for use directly in your database. It leverages the powerful open-source 'modelc' library to transpile linear models consisting of hundreds of parameters to performant 'SQL' in seconds. Unlike other libraries and tools, 'Castpack' was purpose-built for predictive linear and generalized linear models as were first described in Nelder & Wedder (1972) <doi:10.2307/2344614>. This focus on linear models keeps 'Castpack' lightweight, while enabling it to support models that other libraries struggle with.
